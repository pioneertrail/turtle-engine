# Silent Forge: Rebellion of Aethelgard
# Gesture Recognition Results Log
# April 11, 2025

## Trial Run (April 10, 2025, Evening)
- Sensitivity 1.1f:
  - Attempt 1 confidence: 
  - Attempt 2 confidence: 
  - Attempt 3 confidence: 
- Notes: 
- Recommendation for 10:00 AM UTC: [Test 1.0f recommended/Keep 1.1f]

## Test Parameters
- Date: April 11, 2025
- Time: 10:00 AM UTC
- Application: CSLTest
- Gesture: "annihilate" (SWIPE_RIGHT with downward component)
- Sensitivity: 1.1f (temporarily increased from 1.0f)
- Downward heft threshold: y > 0.45f
- Duration check: 0.4s-0.6s (25-37 points at 60 FPS)

## Testing Instructions (10:00 AM UTC)
1. Run CSLTest and perform three "annihilate" gestures
2. Record confidence values for each attempt
3. If confidence < 0.7f for ANY attempt, test with sensitivity 1.0f by 11:00 AM UTC
   - Update GestureRecognizer constructor to revert to 1.0f
   - Add comment: "Reverted post-test due to low confidence"
4. Run GestureTest (10 attempts) and record accuracy statistics
5. Document any visual issues with pulse cohesion

## Results
[Results will be logged here after testing]

## Accuracy Statistics
- Total attempts: 
- Successful recognitions: 
- Accuracy percentage: 
- Average confidence: 

## Sensitivity Testing
- With sensitivity 1.1f:
  - Attempt 1 confidence: 
  - Attempt 2 confidence: 
  - Attempt 3 confidence: 
  - Decision: [Keep 1.1f or revert to 1.0f] - MUST DECIDE BY 11:00 AM UTC
- With sensitivity 1.0f (if tested):
  - Attempt 1 confidence: 
  - Attempt 2 confidence: 
  - Attempt 3 confidence: 
- Final decision: [Keep 1.1f or revert to 1.0f]
- Notes on sensitivity decision: 

## Visual Feedback
- Green pulse: Slower rhythm (5.0f sine, 400.0f time)
- Red flare: Triggered at 25 points (~0.4s)
- Pulse cohesion: Fades as flare peaks
- Pulse cohesion evaluation: [Good/Fair/Poor]
- Notes on visual cohesion: 
- If "Fair" or "Poor", note for April 12 tweak with pulse *= (1.0f - flareIntensity * 1.2f)

## Post-Demo Tasks (April 12)
- Test with Elena's plasma effects (10:00 AM UTC)
- Evaluate pulse cohesion with plasma:
  - Does pulse fade completely as flare peaks?
  - If not, test with pulse *= (1.0f - flareIntensity * 1.2f)
- Finalize visual cohesion between pulse and flare
- Document final adjustments in this log
