# Silent Forge: Rebellion of Aethelgard
# CSL Animation System Demo Script
# April 11, 2025 - 2:00 PM UTC

## Introduction (2:00 PM UTC)
"Witness Aethelgard's defiance."

## Demo Steps
1. Open CSLTest application
2. Perform "annihilate" gesture three times:
   - Right swipe with downward motion
   - Watch the green pulse trace the path
   - Observe the red flare burst at the end
   - Pause briefly between gestures (2-3 seconds)
3. Share GestureTest statistics:
   - "Accuracy >90%, forged true."
   - Cite specific numbers (e.g., "9/10, 92%")

## Technical Notes
- Gesture parameters tuned to Anya's keyframes:
  - 0.0s: Arms raised (x: 20% width, y: 20% height)
  - 0.3s: Right arm down (x: 60% width, y: 50% height)
  - 0.5s: Fists meet (x: 50% width, y: 70% height), 75-pixel arc
- Sensitivity: 1.1f (temporarily increased for testing)
- Visual effects:
  - Green pulse: Slower rhythm (5.0f sine, 400.0f time)
  - Red flare: Triggered at 25 points (~0.4s)
  - Pulse cohesion: Fades as flare peaks

## Presentation Tips
- Stand confidently - this is Aethelgard's moment
- Speak clearly and with conviction
- Emphasize the visual cohesion between pulse and flare
- If asked about sensitivity, explain it was tuned based on testing
- Mention Elena's plasma effects will be integrated by April 12

## Handling Potential Issues
- If a gesture fails (confidence < 0.7f):
  - Smile and say: "Even rebels refine their fire"
  - Try again with a slightly more deliberate motion
  - Focus on the downward component (y > 0.45f)
- If asked about accuracy below 90%:
  - Acknowledge it's a work in progress
  - Mention the sensitivity tuning process
  - Highlight the visual cohesion as the key achievement

## Handling Questions Beyond Demo Scope
- For questions about future gestures (circles, taps):
  - "Our forge burns on - more gestures join our rebellion soon"
- For questions about performance optimization:
  - "We've tuned for the Flammyx's strike - further refinement awaits"
- For questions about integration with other systems:
  - "Elena's plasma joins tomorrow - our visual tale grows"
- For any other technical questions:
  - "Our forge burns on - I'll share details after the demo"

## Post-Demo Tasks
- Log results in gesture_recognition_results.txt
- Test with Elena's plasma effects by April 12
- Finalize visual cohesion between pulse and flare
