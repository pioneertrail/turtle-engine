# Gameplay Design Document

## Overview
Silent Forge: Rebellion of Aethelgard is a tactical action RPG with cooperative multiplayer, set in the world of Chronovya. The game centers around the use of Chronovyan Sign Language (CSL) to cast abilities and combat AI constructs in a world affected by temporal anomalies.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Explore** temporal anomaly zones
2. **Discover** AI construct patterns and weaknesses
3. **Master** CSL gestures and combinations
4. **Defeat** AI constructs using tribal abilities
5. **Gather** resources and knowledge
6. **Upgrade** abilities and equipment
7. **Progress** through increasingly challenging areas

## Key Gameplay Features

### Chronovyan Sign Language (CSL)
The primary gameplay mechanic is the use of CSL gestures to cast abilities:

#### Gesture Types
- **Khargail**: Left-to-right charge gesture, low damage but quick execution
- **Flammil**: Downward swipe, medium damage with area effect
- **Stasai**: Tight circle, creates temporal stasis field
- **Annihlat**: X-shape, high damage with long cooldown

#### Gesture System Mechanics
- **Recognition Confidence**: Higher confidence yields more powerful effects
- **Gesture Speed**: Affects ability power and cooldown
- **Combo System**: Chain gestures for enhanced effects
- **Tribe-Specific Effects**: Same gesture yields different results based on player tribe

#### Control Methods
- **Mouse Gestures**: Draw gestures with mouse movement
- **Quick Signs**: Keyboard shortcuts for faster execution (less powerful)
- **Controller Support**: Right stick gestures or button combinations

### Combat System

#### Weapon Mechanics
- **Plasma Weapons**: Primary weapons with varying charge levels
- **Firing Modes**:
  - **Burst**: Quick, low-damage shots
  - **Beam**: Sustained damage stream
  - **Charged**: High damage, requires charging
  - **Scatter**: Wide area, low precision

#### Enemy AI Construct Types
- **Sentry**: Stationary, long-range attacks, plasma resistance
- **Hunter**: Fast, aggressive, physical resistance
- **Guardian**: Defensive, high health, shields, physical resistance
- **Swarm**: Low health, fast, numerous

#### Health and Damage System

### Temporal Anomaly System

#### Anomaly Types
- **Rift**: Spatial discontinuity, unpredictable effects
- **Stasis**: Time freeze effect
