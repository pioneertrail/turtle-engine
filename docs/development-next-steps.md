# Development Next Steps

This document outlines strategies for improving the project in key areas identified for growth.

## 1. Refining Solo Git Workflow

As your solo project grows in complexity, consider these workflow enhancements:

### Tagging Development Milestones
```bash
# After completing a significant feature or milestone
git tag -a "milestone-1.0" -m "Completed CSL gesture recognition system"
git push origin milestone-1.0
```

### Using Git Worktrees for Parallel Development
Worktrees allow you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching:
```bash
# Create a worktree for a feature branch
git worktree add ../turtle-engine-feature feature/new-system
```

### Automating Routine Tasks with Git Hooks
Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit` for automatic checks:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Run clang-format on changed files
git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | grep -E '\\.(cpp|hpp|h|c)$' | xargs -n1 clang-format -i
git add $(git diff --cached --name-only)
```

### Improved Backup Strategy
```bash
# Create a backup script (backup.ps1)
$date = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
git branch "backup/$date"
git push origin "backup/$date"
```

## 2. Enhancing Test Coverage

### Setting Up a Testing Framework

1. **Structure Tests by Component**:
```
src/tests/
├── unit/               # Unit tests for isolated functions
│   ├── combat/        
│   ├── input/         
│   └── temporal/      
├── integration/        # Tests for component interactions
└── performance/        # Performance benchmarks
```

2. **Create Test Templates**:
```cpp
// test_template.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "component_to_test.hpp"

class ComponentTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
    void SetUp() override {
        // Initialize test objects
    }
    
    void TearDown() override {
        // Clean up resources
    }
    
    // Test objects
};

TEST_F(ComponentTest, TestFunctionality) {
    // Arrange
    
    // Act
    
    // Assert
    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);
}
```

3. **Add Test Coverage Measurement**:
   - Use tools like gcov/lcov or OpenCppCoverage
   - Aim for >80% coverage for critical systems

4. **Implement Test Automation**:
   - Create a test runner script:
```bash
# test_runner.ps1
cmake --build build --target tests
cd build
ctest -V
```

## 3. Documenting Edge Cases for Temporal System

### Create an Edge Case Documentation Template

For each temporal system component, document:

1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Zero duration anomalies
   - Overlapping anomalies
   - Maximum/minimum distortion values

2. **Interaction Patterns**:
   - Entity entering/exiting anomaly boundaries
   - Multiple anomalies affecting one entity
   - Nested anomaly effects

3. **Error States**:
   - Invalid effect parameters
   - Resource exhaustion scenarios
   - Thread synchronization issues

### Example Edge Case Documentation:

```markdown
# Temporal Anomaly Edge Cases

## Overlapping Anomalies

### Scenario
Two or more anomalies with different types and distortion values affect the same entity.

### Expected Behavior
1. Effects are applied in order of anomaly creation
2. Time distortion is calculated as: finalFactor = product of all distortion factors
3. If conflicting types (e.g., DILATION and ACCELERATION), the strongest effect takes precedence

### Implementation Notes
```cpp
// Apply multiple anomaly effects
float resolveMultipleDistortionFactors(const std::vector<float>& factors) {
    float resultFactor = 1.0f;
    for (float factor : factors) {
        resultFactor *= factor;
    }
    return resultFactor;
}
```

### Potential Issues
- Performance impact with >10 overlapping anomalies
- Precision loss with extreme distortion values
- Visual artifacts at anomaly boundaries
```

## 4. Continuous Improvement Process

Implement a regular "tech debt" cycle:

1. **Weekly Code Review**:
   - Review one component per week
   - Document areas needing improvement
   - Create specific, targeted tasks

2. **Monthly Refactoring Sessions**:
   - Schedule dedicated time for refactoring
   - Focus on highest-impact improvements
   - Document changes and performance impacts

3. **Development Journal**:
   - Keep notes on challenges and solutions
   - Document decisions and their rationale
   - Track performance improvements over time

By systematically addressing these areas, you'll build a more robust, maintainable codebase while developing your skills as a developer.
