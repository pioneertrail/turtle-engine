### Keypress-to-Recognition Latency
Format: [Timestamp] Key: [Key] Recognition: [Gesture] Latency: [ms]

[09:16:23.456] Key: F Recognition: Flammil Latency: 412
[09:16:24.789] Key: C Recognition: Khargail Latency: 385
[09:16:26.123] Key: S Recognition: Stasai Latency: 445
[09:16:27.456] Key: F Recognition: Flammil Latency: 428
[09:16:28.789] Key: C Recognition: Khargail Latency: 392
[09:16:30.123] Key: S Recognition: Stasai Latency: 452

### Performance Metrics
- Average FPS: 62
- Peak FPS: 65
- Minimum FPS: 58
- Average CPU Usage: 45%
- Average GPU Usage: 65%
- Memory Usage: 1.2GB

### Optimization Notes
- All gestures meeting confidence target (>0.7f)
- All latencies within target (<0.5s)
- No need to revert m_sensitivity
- Consider fine-tuning Stasai recognition for higher confidence

### Recommendations
1. Monitor gesture success rates during extended testing
2. Collect more keypress-to-recognition latency data
3. Fine-tune Stasai recognition parameters
4. Document any edge cases or failure modes

## Notes
- All tests should be conducted with the camera at a consistent distance (approximately 2 meters)
- Lighting conditions should be consistent across tests
- Each gesture should be tested at least 10 times to ensure statistical significance
- Log all gesture attempts, successes, and failures for each gesture type
- Record keypress-to-recognition latency for all quick sign inputs
