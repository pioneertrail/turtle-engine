# Version Control Update Notification

**Date:** April 11, 2025  
**Subject:** Implementation of GitHub Workflow Documentation and Code Ownership Structure  
**To:** Gabriel Huerta (@gabrielhuerta) and Silent Forge Development Team

## Summary
We have updated our version control practices and established a formal code ownership structure to enhance collaboration and maintain code quality as we progress from Phase 1 to Phase 2 of the Silent Forge: Rebellion of Aethelgard project.

## Key Changes
1. **GitHub Workflow Documentation**
   - Comprehensive workflow guidelines are now available in `docs/technical/workflow.md`
   - Established branch strategy, commit message format, and PR process
   - Defined versioning and release procedures
   - Outlined CI/CD pipeline configuration

2. **Code Ownership**
   - Created `.github/CODEOWNERS` file designating code ownership
   - Gabriel Huerta (@gabrielhuerta) is now the primary code owner for:
     - Combat systems (`/src/engine/combat/`)
     - Temporal systems (`/src/engine/temporal/`)
     - Health systems (`/src/engine/health/`)
     - Documentation (`/docs/`)
     - Test files (`/tests/`)

3. **CI/CD Implementation**
   - Added GitHub Actions workflows:
     - PR validation that automatically runs on all pull requests
     - Release pipeline for creating releases and artifacts

## Immediate Actions
1. **For All Team Members**:
   - Review the workflow documentation at `docs/technical/workflow.md`
   - Start following the new commit message format and branch naming conventions
   - Create PRs according to the new template
   - Note the 48-hour (24-hour for hotfixes) review timeline

2. **For Gabriel Huerta**:
   - Review your code ownership assignments
   - You will now receive automatic review requests for changes to files in your owned directories

## Benefits
- Standardized workflow for all contributors
- Clear accountability for code reviews
- Automated testing and validation
- Structured release management
- Better documentation maintenance
