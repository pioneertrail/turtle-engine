## Security Best Practices

When using Turtle Engine:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update GLEW, GLFW, and other dependencies
   - Monitor our security advisories

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all shader inputs
   - Sanitize file paths
   - Check buffer sizes

3. **Resource Management**
   - Use RAII patterns
   - Check memory allocations
   - Properly clean up OpenGL resources

4. **Error Handling**
   - Check OpenGL errors
   - Validate shader compilation
   - Handle out-of-memory conditions

## Security Features

Turtle Engine includes several security features:

1. **Memory Safety**
   - RAII resource management
   - Bounds checking on buffers
   - Smart pointer usage

2. **Input Validation**
   - Shader validation
   - Path sanitization
   - Buffer size verification

3. **Error Detection**
   - OpenGL error checking
   - Exception handling
   - Resource leak detection

## Development Security

When contributing:

1. **Code Review**
   - All changes undergo security review
   - Static analysis tools are used
   - Dependencies are vetted

2. **Testing**
   - Security test cases required
   - Fuzzing for input handling
   - Memory leak checks
